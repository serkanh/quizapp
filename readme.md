## Development

The project is set up for easy development with Docker:

- The frontend uses React's development server with hot reloading.
- The backend uses nodemon to automatically restart on file changes.
- Local directories are mounted as volumes, so changes to your code will be reflected immediately without needing to rebuild Docker images.

## Notes

- This application uses Google Translate's Text-to-Speech API unofficially. For a production application, consider using a properly licensed TTS service.
- The current setup is optimized for development. For production, you would need to make appropriate changes, such as building the frontend for production and adjusting security settings.
